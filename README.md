# XJDF & JDF Specifications
JDF (Job Definition Format) is an interchange data format to be used by a system of administrative and implementation-oriented components, which together produce printed products. It provides the means to describe print Jobs in terms of the products eventually to be created, as well as in terms of the Processes needed to create those products. The format provides a mechanism to explicitly specify the controls needed by each Process, which might be specific to the Devices that will execute the Processes.
